Â¡Welcome to my first script in bash! =)

I have made this tool for my personal use, I share it in case someone find it useful.

To run *tup in your Linux distro, copy and paste it in .sh or .txt file and execute it with bash or add its path with an alias.

Tested in Kali Linux and Kali with AutoBSPWM.

Feel free to change what you want,

Thank you for your visit!
