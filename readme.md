Welcome to star-tup friend =)

This is my first script on bash and my first repo!

I make this tool to practise bash script and for my personal use, I share it in case someone find it useful.

To run *tup in your Linux distro, copy the script and paste it in .sh or .txt file and execute it with bash or add its path with an alias of your choice, I obviously recommend "startup"!

*** It is necessary to install screefetch or customize finish function to avoid errors ***

Tested in Kali Linux and Kali with AutoBSP.

Feel free to change what you want and leave a pull request with your improvements, 

Thank you for your visit!
